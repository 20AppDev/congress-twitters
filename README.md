# Congress Twitters

This repo is for you to use to type along to the Web scraping video if you wish, or to experiment scraping a website of your choice. There's no automated tests, nothing to `rails grade`, and nothing to submit.

## Standard Workflow

 1. Set up the project: `bin/setup`
 2. Start the web server: `bin/server`
 3. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **commit often as you work.**
